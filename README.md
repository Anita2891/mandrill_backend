# mandrill_backend
To implement the desired functionality, we can use Python and the following technology stack:

    Flask framework for the backend application
    Redis for caching and storing event data
    Redis Pub/Sub mechanism for real-time notifications to the user interface
    WebSocket protocol for the real-time communication between the backend and frontend

Here is a high-level overview of the steps we need to take:

-   Set up a webhook on Mandrill to send event notifications to our backend application endpoint. The endpoint will receive a JSON payload with the event data, including the Mandrill message ID.

-   Create a Python script to handle the incoming events. We can use the Flask framework to create a web server that listens for incoming requests at the webhook endpoint.

-   When an event is received, parse the JSON payload and store it in Redis using the Mandrill message ID as the key.

-   Use Redis Pub/Sub mechanism to notify the user interface in real-time about the events. We can create a publisher that sends a message to a channel when an event is received, and a subscriber that listens for messages on that channel.

-   On the frontend side, we can create a simple HTML file with a WebSocket client that listens for messages from the backend and displays them to the user as they come in.


Overall, this implementation uses the observer and publisher-subscriber design patterns to achieve the desired functionality. The backend application acts as an observer of the events, and the Redis Pub/Sub mechanism acts as a publisher-subscriber for real-time notifications. Redis is used as a caching and messaging layer, and WebSocket protocol is used for real-time communication between the backend and frontend.
